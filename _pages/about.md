I'm a mixed methods social psychologist interested in the influence of climate and culture on peoples experiences. More specifically I am interested in the social, behavioral and health implications of diversity and inequality for both advantaged and disadvantaged groups.

I'm currently a PhD candidate at the University of Washington, working in the [culture, diversity, and health lab](https://depts.washington.edu/cdhlab/).

I have expertise in theories of human behavior, experimental and survey design, data wrangling/visualization, statistics, and statistical modeling using R.
